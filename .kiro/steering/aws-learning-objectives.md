# AWS Learning Objectives - Brew Haven Training Platform

## Project Purpose
Brew Haven serves as a comprehensive AWS training platform that demonstrates real-world cloud architecture patterns, services integration, and best practices through a practical coffee shop application.

## AWS Services Integration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Services (Current)
- **S3**: Static asset storage, image hosting
- **DynamoDB**: Product catalog storage
- **EC2/ECS**: Application hosting
- **IAM**: Security and access management

### Phase 2: Order System Enhancement
- **RDS**: Relational order data with PostgreSQL
- **ElastiCache**: Session management and cart caching
- **SQS**: Order processing queue
- **SNS**: Order notification system
- **Lambda**: Event-driven order processing

### Phase 3: Advanced Architecture
- **API Gateway**: Serverless API management
- **Cognito**: Customer authentication and user management
- **Step Functions**: Order workflow orchestration
- **EventBridge**: Event-driven architecture
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and observability

### Phase 4: Analytics and Intelligence
- **Kinesis**: Real-time order analytics
- **OpenSearch**: Search and analytics
- **QuickSight**: Business intelligence dashboards
- **Bedrock**: AI-powered recommendations

### Phase 5: Enterprise Features
- **CloudFront**: Global content delivery
- **WAF**: Web application firewall
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure configuration management
- **Systems Manager**: Parameter store and automation
- **CloudFormation/CDK**: Infrastructure as code

## Learning Objectives by Service

### Database Services
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL design patterns, GSI usage, capacity planning
- **RDS**: Relational design, transactions, read replicas, backup strategies
- **ElastiCache**: Caching patterns, session management, performance optimization

### Compute Services
- **Lambda**: Serverless patterns, event-driven architecture, cold starts
- **ECS/Fargate**: Containerized applications, service discovery, load balancing
- **Step Functions**: Workflow orchestration, error handling, state machines

### Integration Services
- **SQS**: Message queuing, dead letter queues, visibility timeout
- **SNS**: Pub/sub patterns, fan-out messaging, mobile push notifications
- **EventBridge**: Event-driven architecture, custom events, rule patterns

### Security Services
- **IAM**: Least privilege, roles vs users, policy design
- **Cognito**: Authentication flows, user pools, identity pools
- **Secrets Manager**: Credential rotation, secure access patterns

### Monitoring and Observability
- **CloudWatch**: Metrics, logs, alarms, dashboards
- **X-Ray**: Distributed tracing, performance analysis
- **CloudTrail**: API auditing, compliance, security monitoring

## Architecture Evolution Strategy

### Current State: Monolithic FastAPI
- Single application handling all functionality
- Direct database connections
- Session-based authentication

### Target State: Microservices with Event-Driven Architecture
- Order service (Lambda + RDS)
- Notification service (Lambda + SNS)
- Analytics service (Kinesis + OpenSearch)
- User management (Cognito)
- API orchestration (API Gateway)

## Training Scenarios

### Beginner Level
- Basic CRUD operations with DynamoDB
- S3 static hosting and file uploads
- EC2 deployment and security groups
- IAM roles and policies

### Intermediate Level
- RDS setup and connection pooling
- SQS message processing
- Lambda function development
- CloudWatch monitoring setup

### Advanced Level
- Step Functions workflow design
- EventBridge custom events
- Multi-region deployment
- Performance optimization

### Expert Level
- Infrastructure as Code with CDK
- CI/CD pipeline with CodePipeline
- Security best practices implementation
- Cost optimization strategies

## Demo Use Cases

### Service Integration Demos
- **Order Processing**: API Gateway → Lambda → RDS → SQS → SNS
- **Real-time Analytics**: DynamoDB Streams → Kinesis → Lambda → OpenSearch
- **User Authentication**: Cognito → API Gateway → Lambda authorizers
- **File Processing**: S3 → Lambda → Rekognition → DynamoDB

### Architecture Pattern Demos
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Order events triggering multiple services
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read/write models for orders and analytics
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction handling with Step Functions
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilient service communication patterns

## Success Metrics
