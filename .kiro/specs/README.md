# Specs Directory

This directory contains feature specifications for the Brew Haven coffee shop application. Each spec follows the structured approach of:

1. **Requirements** - User stories and acceptance criteria in EARS format
2. **Design** - Technical architecture and implementation approach  
3. **Tasks** - Actionable implementation steps for developers

## Current Specs

This directory is ready for new feature specifications. When creating specs, use the kebab-case naming convention for feature directories (e.g., `user-authentication`, `order-management`, etc.).

## Spec Structure

Each spec should contain:
- `requirements.md` - Feature requirements and user stories
- `design.md` - Technical design and architecture
- `tasks.md` - Implementation task list with checkboxes

## Getting Started

To create a new spec, you can either:
1. Use the spec creation workflow to guide you through requirements, design, and tasks
2. Manually create the spec directory and files following the established patterns

The spec-driven development approach helps ensure features are well-planned before implementation begins.
